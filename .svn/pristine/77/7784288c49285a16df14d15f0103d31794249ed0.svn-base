      <h3>Lost Business Opportunities</h3>
      <p>
        Difficulty in drawing decisions from data and a lack of data reuse across business
        functions result in lost opportunities. We help democratize data usage through self-service
        and diverse analytics tools, facilitating smooth collaboration, experimentation, and faster
        decision-making.

      <p>
        Poor quality or unclear data ownership leads to misalignment in different segments of your
        business. We enable distributed domain data ownership, create a value-driven data governance
        framework, and enhance data integration to increase data quality and accuracy.

        Inefficient resource allocation, such as time, money, and manpower, due to insufficient data
        or improper data analysis leads to overspending in some sectors and underspending in others.
